# FitMix
######An online mixing tool that allows fitness professionals and enthusiasts to tailor their music to their workout routines.
Typically, playlists for workouts and fitness classes are static--at most, theyâ€™re themed and ordered for a certain effect. FitMix arms athletes and instructors with extensive control for creating dynamic exercise mixes that follow the structure and intensity of their workouts; users can enhance their mixes with sound effects and text-to-speech instructions, even as they clip the best parts of their favorite songs to create invigorating motivational mashups.

Though it gives athletes powerful tools for editing their music, FitMix maintains a straightforward, intuitive interface. Features such as drag-and-drop reordering, dynamic resizing, and one-click track cropping lets anyone create great mixes with no experience needed.
