Typically, playlists for workouts and fitness classes are static—at most, they’re themed and ordered for a certain effect. FitMix arms athletes and instructors with extensive control for creating dynamic exercise mixes that follow the structure and intensity of their workouts; users can enhance their mixes with sound effects and text-to-speech instructions while they clip the best parts of their favorite songs to create invigorating motivational mashups.

FitMix gives athletes powerful tools for editing their music and it maintains a straightforward, intuitive interface for doing so. Drag-and-drop reordering, dynamic resizing, and one-click track cropping let anyone create great mixes with no experience needed.
